# Foreword
 This is the second component of the **P**ipeline for **A**gile **E**stimation of **L**and **A**ccounts (PAELA project). The **first component** aims at acquiring two different information:
 
 - Satellite information that will inform on some features of the nature of the soil as seen from space through several sensors and lenses 
 - Curated information for several Regions of Interest (ROIs) with different land cover classes that will serve as "*ground truth*" references for a Machine Learning model to learn how to relate satellite images (pixels) with on the ground classification.
 
This **second** component will use the first component (data) as input to train a Machine Learning model designed and optimized to be  used by the third component to estimate land cover at various scales, locations and dates. This second component will provide a ready-to-use, fully trained model for classification of land types. It follows agile programming framework with separated and individual chunks fully adjustable and reproducible.   

The **third** component will then use this model (second component) to estimate several land cover maps and integrate these maps into a framework for computing and verifying the transition btween years needed for Land Accounting. 

# Training the machine Learning Model 

### Packages needed for traininga Machine learning model

As usual when working with specific data, We need both generic and specific packages. We have 3 broad categories: 
- Packages specific to GIS and maps such as  `sf` and `raster`
- Packages specific to Data Science and Machine Learning, in particular the package `CARET` that embeds many models and post-estimation features and graphics
- Generic packages for data management, visualization and dissemination such as `dplyr` and  `ggplot2`.   

```{r packages}
# GIS packages
library(raster) ## for reading "RASTER" files
library(sf)     ## read shapefiles
#library(rgdal)  ## for reading "shapefiles"
library(sp)     ## for adjusting CRS in 
library(terra)  ## see https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/image-raster-data-r

# Model fitting packages for ML
library(rpart)
library(caret)

# File management
library(readxl)
# Tidy data management packages
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(modelsummary)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(forcats)

# Plotting packages
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library("patchwork") # To combine plots

# Nice presentation of results
library(knitr)
library(papeR)

# My colors:
SIAP.color <- "#0385a8"
SIAP.red <- "#eb4034"

```
# Data and files management

Firstly, we must define the year under study. We'll put that into parameters that will be used now consistently over the whole program. 

```{r}
MyDir <- "GIS-ROI-V2"
StudyYear  <- 2020
```

> The year under study is  **`r StudyYear `**

We will import and export files in different format, including GIS specific files in formats that can be *raster* (images) or *shapefiles* (vectors). Also, we will eed to combine, assemble and transform these files to use them as data frames for the Machine Learning model.  

## Importing geospatial information

There are many data sources freely available with environmental information at a very detailed level. These files are from huge data bases that cover large areas of the word. 

## a. Importing the stack of images (TIFF)
From QGIS, we import the images that corresponds to the island of Efate. 

```{r}
# import stacked raster (TIFF images)  
# Needs  sf package 

img <- brick(paste0("Data/",MyDir,"/stacked_image_",StudyYear,"_20m.tif"))
```
 
These are images taken with different bands and reflecting the nature of waves coming back from the satellite sensors. These will be our predictors, or explanatory variables, for our model, as the information is available for any point on the region.  

```{r, cache=TRUE}
plot(img)
```

##  b.  ROIs or "ground truth land classes" (shapefiles)

The Region of Interest or **ROIs** are also called  "*ground truth*"  areas where we *know* or *observed*  the nature of the the land and its class. This is a limited sample and this sample is important for training our model and for validating the model trained and compute its accuracy on a validation sub sample. So that sample will define the set of points where the information is available. Here  it comes directly from QGIS as a shapefile (*.shp*).

> **TODO:** See Blanca's message for explanation on the construction of the ROIs

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Importing ROIs (Shapefiles)

shp <- read_sf(paste0("Data/",MyDir,"/ROI",StudyYear,"/"))
```


```{r}
# extract classes and band information and put in a dataframe for later
names(img) <- c("4_red", "3_green", "2_blue", "8_nir", "11_swir16", "y_ndvi", "y_mndwi", "y_savi", "y_bsi", "y_vcp", "dry_ndvi", "dry_mndwi","dry_bsi","wet_ndvi","wet_mndwi","wet_bsi")
```

## c. Matching the information from Raster (bands) with class values on the ground 

We can now match the information from the ground truth, with what is available from the images (raster). This operation, that uses the exact location and a perfect geographical alignment, will provide a sample with both the information of the nature of the land (in classes)and the information from the  satellite (predictors). 
 
```{r, cache=TRUE}
DataForModel <- terra::extract(img, shp, df = TRUE)

# Creating class for each location 
DataForModel$class <- as.factor(shp$MC_ID[match(DataForModel$ID, seq(nrow(shp)))])

# We need a numeric variable as well 
DataForModel <- DataForModel %>%
   mutate(classnum = as.numeric(class))

##  Keeping the number of classes
NbClass <- length(unique(DataForModel$class))

```

>**TODO** We can label the `r NbClass` land classes for a better interpretation and visualization


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# NOT RUN (no name for classes)
# Let us define the classes with their names instead of numbers

# Define the class labels
class_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Dense_vegetation",
  "2" = "Pastureland_grassland",
  "3" = "Other_vegetation", 
  "4" = "Built-up", 
  "5" = "Water",
  "6" = "Reef", 
  "7" = "Cloud"
)

# We affect labels as defined by class_labels, to the variable class
DataForModel$class <- factor(DataForModel$class, levels = names(class_labels), labels = class_labels)

```


```{r}
# Saving the Dataset for Modeling as a csv file to avoid rerunning these lengthy steps
save(DataForModel, file = paste0("Data/",MyDir,"/DataForModel.Rda"))

# Uncomment to load the data
# load("Data/GIS-ROI-V1/DataForModel.Rda")

```

We have now a data frame `DataForModel`with `r nrow(DataForModel)` observations. The data frame contains the land cover classification variable `class`  to predict, and several explanatory variables or *predictors*  `

## Summary statistics

Let's have a look at the  sample created with **`r nrow(DataForModel)`**  observations:



```{r, echo = TRUE}
DataForModel %>%
  # Reorder and reverse factor levels
  mutate(class = fct_infreq(class) %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  # Calculate percentages
  count(class, name = "count") %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1)) %>% # Calculate percentages
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = class)) +  # Use x = count for horizontal bar lengths
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = SIAP.color, colour = "white", width = 0.8) +
  # Add percentages
  geom_text(aes(x = count, label = paste0(percentage, "%")), hjust = -0.1, color = SIAP.color, size = 4) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +  # Extend the x-axis for labels
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  ggtitle("Land Types")
```

> **TODO** : Review this : There is a  **class imbalance** in the explanatory variable `class`, with classes  *pasture land/ Grassland*  and *Other vegetation* being more numerous than other classes. We need to keep in mind as this may affect the machine Learning model.  



## Predictors 
The list of explanatory variables (or *predictors*) are the different bands from the satellite images. For each location, we have a value from each band stored in a variable. 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Define the subset of variables (here X1, X, .., X8B, ...X12)
predictor_vars <- DataForModel %>%
  select(starts_with(c("X", "y_", "dry", "wet"))) %>%
  names()

predictor_vars

```
In total with have **`r length(predictor_vars)`** predictors. 

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
datasummary_skim(select(DataForModel, predictor_vars) ,   type = "numeric",
                 title = "Full data set (DataForModel)",
                notes = paste("N =", nrow(DataForModel)) )
```


# Explanatory variables analysis

It is always a good thing to explore the variables that we are going to use as predictor and try to find variables that are related to each other. Here the bands are not really easy to interpret but we can still see some patterns.

 More importantly, we may identify groups of variables that are correlated, as well as the variables that are not correlated with any other. Those could capture unique features of the images having nice predicting power.


```{r}
# We compute the correlation matrix of the covariates
corr_coef<-cor(DataForModel[, predictor_vars], use = "p")

#And then plot it with nice options 
ggcorrplot(corr_coef, 
           type = "lower",         # lower triangle of the matrix only
           hc.order = TRUE,        # variable sorted from highest to lowest
           outline.col = "white",  #Color options
           lab = TRUE, 
           lab_size = 2)
```


The data preparation & validation methods ends here, so let’s process to machine learning models.

# Machine learning

As usual in Machine Learning, we need to divide the original sample with `r nrow(DataForModel)`  into *training*  and *validation*  samples based on a  80-20\% rule. This has to be done randomly to avoid any pattern to be appearing in only one of the two samples that should have the same characteristics.  

## Train and Validation data sets

```{r }
# Splits data into training and testing sets
set.seed(007)  # Seed for splitting train/validation sets

# We randomly pick observations (indexes) from the full data set
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(DataForModel$class, p = .80, 
                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)

# Creating the two data sets by partition 
train_data <- DataForModel[ trainIndex,]
validation_data  <- DataForModel[-trainIndex,]

```


We have `r nrow(train_data)` observations in the training data set (80\%) and `r nrow(validation_data)` observations in the validation data set (20\%). It is important to have a look at our train data set and check if it has the same characteristics, in particular for the categories distribution.  

```{r,  results= TRUE }
datasummary_skim(train_data$class , type = "categorical",
                 title = "Train data set",
                 notes = paste("N =", nrow(train_data))) 
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Graphics to compare 
# train data set
p_Train <- train_data %>%
mutate(class = fct_infreq(class) %>% fct_rev()) %>%  # Reorder and reverse factor levels
# Calculate percentages
 count(class, name = "count") %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1)) %>% # Calculate percentages
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = class)) +  # Use x = count for horizontal bar lengths
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = SIAP.color, colour = "white", width = 0.8) +
  # Add percentages
  geom_text(aes(x = count, label = paste0(percentage, "%")), hjust = -0.05, color = SIAP.color, size = 4) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.2))) +  # Extend the x-axis for labels
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ 
  labs(x = "", y = "", 
       title = "Land types",
       subtitle = "Train data set", 
        caption =  paste ( "N= ", nrow(train_data)))

# Validation  
p_Valid <- validation_data %>%
mutate(class = fct_infreq(class) %>% fct_rev()) %>%  # Reorder and reverse factor levels
# Calculate percentages
 count(class, name = "count") %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1)) %>% # Calculate percentages
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = class)) +  # Use x = count for horizontal bar lengths
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = SIAP.color, colour = "white", width = 0.8) +
  # Add percentages
  geom_text(aes(x = count, label = paste0(percentage, "%")), hjust = -0.05, color = SIAP.color, size = 4) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.2))) +  # Extend the x-axis for labels
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ 
  labs(x = "", y = "", 
       title = "Land types",
       subtitle = "Validation data set", 
        caption =  paste ( "N= ", nrow(validation_data)))

# Combined plot 
p_Train | p_Valid


```



##  Missing values in the training and validation data sets
After creating the two sub-samples, it is good to check whether the process worked well and has not created any missing observation (that may happen!). 

```{r}
# Checking missing values see https://rpubs.com/NguyenKhanh20/1069336

mis_train <- sum(is.na(train_data))
mis_train_obs  <- nrow(train_data[!complete.cases(train_data), ])

mis_valid <- sum(is.na(validation_data))
mis_valid_obs  <- nrow(validation_data[!complete.cases(validation_data), ])

```

We  have **`r mis_train` missing values** in the training data set (any variables) and **`r mis_valid`** missing values for the validation data set.  This concerns **`r mis_train_obs`** observation(s) in the training data set and **`r mis_valid_obs`**  observation(s) in the validation data set.  If we observe some missing, we should remove these observations  to have non missing training and validation data sets. 

```{r}
# removing the missing observation from training data set  
train_data <- train_data[complete.cases(train_data), ]
validation_data <- validation_data[complete.cases(validation_data), ]
```

##  Selecting Cross Validation parameters

```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# function to set up random seeds when running on several cores 
#  (you do not need to understand that)

setSeeds <- function(method = "cv", numbers = 1, repeats = 1, tunes = NULL, seed = 2512) {
  #B is the number of resamples and integer vector of M (numbers + tune length if any)
  B <- if (method == "cv") numbers
  else if(method == "repeatedcv") numbers * repeats
  else NULL
  
  if(is.null(length)) {
    seeds <- NULL
  } else {
    set.seed(seed = seed)
    seeds <- vector(mode = "list", length = B)
    seeds <- lapply(seeds, function(x) sample.int(n = 1000000, size = numbers + ifelse(is.null(tunes), 0, tunes)))
    seeds[[length(seeds) + 1]] <- sample.int(n = 1000000, size = 1)
  }
  # return seeds
  seeds
}

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Summary function with six statistics of interest 
# sixStats <- function(...) c(twoClassSummary(...), 
#                             defaultSummary(...))
```

By default, repeated K-fold cross-validation is used here. The function `r `trainControl` can be used to specify the type of resampling. We use here K= 5 and 10 repetition of the process. We then estimate 5 x 10 = 50 different predictions.

```{r controls}
# control variables (see later)
K <- 5        # K for K-fold Cross-Validation
Myrepeats <- 10
rcvTunes <- 1  # tune number of models
Myseed <- 2512 # Seed for ML training

```


##  Random Forest

We begin with fitting a Random Forest model using cross-validation on the *Training* data set 

Random Forest is a *bagging* (*bootstrap aggregation*) method. During training a bootstrap sample is drawn from the training data together with a subset of the total amount of variables, we then pick the best available variable to split the tree into two daughter nodes repeatedly until we reach a stopping criterion. This process is repeated until we have trained as many individual decision trees as we want. We can then combine the output of the decision trees into one final output.

Our final output will be based on the **majority vote** of the individual decision trees.


> We may refer to the *caret* [package manual](https://topepo.github.io/caret/model-training-and-tuning.html) to learn about all the options and models available. The algorithm that will be conducted all along this exercise is the following:
![](https://topepo.github.io/caret/premade/TrainAlgo.png)


```{r, include = FALSE}
# Repeated cross validation
rcvSeeds <- setSeeds(method = "repeatedcv", 
                      numbers = K,
                      repeats = Myrepeats, 
                      tunes = 100,
                      seed = Myseed)


# Configure the trainControl argument for cross-validation
K5_CV_seed <- trainControl(method = "cv", 
                           number = K,
                           classProbs = FALSE, 
                           savePredictions = TRUE,
                           seeds = rcvSeeds,
                           allowParallel = TRUE)

```


###  Training the model on selected variables 

We can decide to train the model on all the explanatory variables (using  `.` as right-hand side of the formula as below) or an only a subset of the variables that are available to us:

* So using all variables would write  `rf_fit <- train(class ~ . ,  ... `
* Alternatively, we could use a `formula`  and write `rf_fit <- train(formula, ... `

For more flexibility, we use that second option here:
```{r}
# The formula definition with defined predictors 
formula <- as.formula(paste("class ~", paste(predictor_vars, collapse = " + ")))
```

> Our `formula` with  `r `length(predictor_vars)` is:   `r paste("class ~", paste(predictor_vars, collapse = " + "))`  

And we can train our model: 

```{r, cache = FALSE}
# Train your model using the subset of variables
rf_fit <- train(formula,
                data = train_data,
                method = "rf",
                ntree = 100,
                trControl = K5_CV_seed)
```

```{r, results=TRUE}
rf_fit
```

By default, `caret` does a minimal search on the number of variables used for each node of each tree, `mtry`. While training the model,  `caret` searched for 3 values of  `mtry`, here  (all) and provides the value of the accuracy and Kappa for each of these choices.  By default, it will the  select the value that maximize the accuracy. Obviously, we can also try to optimize this choice and do our own selection. 

## Playing with parameters for the RF model 

The package `caret` allows a lot of testing for the "right" choice of parameters affecting random forest models.  In particular `mtry`  and `ntree`. Let us change these parameters and see how this affects our model accuracy 


### The number of variables used for each node of each tree `mtry`
By default, `caret`does a minimal search of 3 different numbers for `mtry` and selects the one that maximize accuracy. Let's change that parameter to do an extensive **grid search** up to the maximum possible. 
 
 > Here the maximum number is `r length(predictor_vars) -1`,  since we have "only" `r length(predictor_vars)` predictor and we need at least one! 
 
```{r mtrygrid, cache=TRUE}
rf_fit <- train(formula,
                data = train_data,
                method = "rf",
                ntree = 100,
                tuneLength = 16, #  <- computes for 9 values of mtry
                metric= "Kappa",  # we can choose the criteria (Kappa vs Accuracy)
                trControl = K5_CV_seed)
                
                
```

```{r, results=TRUE}
rf_fit

# Best number of trees
mtry_best <- rf_fit$bestTune[[1]]
```
The results, in terms of accuracy (or *Kappa*) can be visualized to identify the best value for the number of regressors per  `mtry` leading to the highest accuracy.  


```{r}
# Getting the results
rf_results <- rf_fit$results

# Plot of accuracy
p_A <- ggplot(rf_results, aes(x = mtry, y = Accuracy)) +
  geom_line(color = SIAP.color) +
  geom_point(size = 1, color = SIAP.color) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(rf_results$mtry), max(rf_results$mtry), by = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Random Forest Accuracy by mtry",
    subtitle = paste("Year: ", StudyYear,""),
    x = "Number of Variables at Each Split (mtry))",
    y = "Accuracy"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot of Kappa
p_K <- ggplot(rf_results, aes(x = mtry, y = Kappa)) +
  geom_line(color = SIAP.color) +
  geom_point(size = 1, color = SIAP.color) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(rf_results$mtry), max(rf_results$mtry), by = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Random Forest Kappa by mtry",
    subtitle = paste("Year: ", StudyYear),
    x = "Number of Variables  at Each Split (mtry))",
    y = "kappa"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine the plots
p_A |  p_K

```




From these graphics, we can conclude that the we should select **`r mtry_best`  regressors** per trees in the random forest model, and then set the `mtry` parameter accordingly (to `r mtry_best`).


```{r EX,  include=FALSE}
knit_exit()
```



### The number of trees  used `ntree`

Even better, we can combine the search of  `ntree` with the search if `mtry` using a grid search. Since we know that our best choice for  `mtry` was to use only `r mtry_best`  regressors per trees in the random forest, we can impose that choice in our grid. 


```{r, cache = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# /!\ running this chunk can be long!
modellist <- list()

# Uses the optimal mtry from the previous model
grid <- expand.grid(.mtry=  mtry_best)

#train with different ntree parameters, to find an optimal amount of trees
for (i_ntree in c(50, 100, 250, 500)){
  set.seed(2512)
  fit <- train(formula,
                data = train_data,
                method = "rf",
                metric = 'Accuracy',
                tuneGrid = grid,
                trControl = K5_CV_seed,
                ntree = i_ntree)
  key <- toString(i_ntree)
  modellist[[key]] <- fit
}


ntree_best <- fit$dots$ntree

```

```{r include=FALSE}
#Compare results
results <- resamples(modellist)
summary(results)
```


```{r ntreeANDaccuracy, echo=FALSE}
# We need to do a bit of rearrangement to have the results in a way easy to plot with ggplot 
library(tidyr)

results_long <- as.data.frame(results) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -c(Resample), names_to = "SampleSize", values_to = "accuracy")

# Computing the lower bound for nice visual
MyLowerY <-min(results_long$accuracy) - (0.2*(max(results_long$accuracy) - min(results_long$accuracy)) )

# Ordering the  boxplot according to sample size
results_long <- results_long %>%
  mutate(SampleSize = factor(SampleSize, levels = sort(unique(as.numeric(SampleSize))))) 

 ggplot(data= results_long)+
  aes(x = SampleSize, y = accuracy) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = SIAP.color, alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_point(col = "grey")+
 # ylim(MyLowerY, 1)+
  ggtitle(label = "Optimizing the accuracy of the Random Forest model") +
  labs(x = "Number of trees (ntree)" )+
  theme_minimal()
  
```

We now know that the optimal number of trees seems to be `ntree` = **`r ntree_best`**. This result, combined with the the optimal number of predictors *per* tree (set to `mtry` = `r mtry_best`) allows us to **fine-tune** our machine learning model. `


### Final model selection

Based on what we have discovered, it seems that selecting a Random Forest model with **`ntree` = `r ntree_best`**, **`mtry` = `r mtry_best`**  should be a quite good option. Since we have quite imbalance classes, we also will rely more on the value of the  *kappa* parameter that in the pure accuracy in the remaining part of the analysis 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Uses the optimal mtry from the previous model

grid <- expand.grid(.mtry=  mtry_best)
ntree = ntree_best

#Train a model  with fixed mtry and ntree parameters, other parameters are as previously defined 
rf_final_fit <- train(formula,
                data = train_data,
                method = "rf",
                metric = 'kappa',
                tuneGrid = grid,
                trControl = K5_CV_seed,

## Evaluating Model Performance 

We can assess the quality of the model both *in sample*, that is how well the model estimates the data within the training data set  or  *out of sample* , where we compare predictions based on a validation data set (or "*unseen data*").  The results with both samples are interesting and should provide us with different information on the quality of the training and on the performance of the trained model on new, unseen, data sets.   

###  *In sample* performance

We can assess the performance of the trained model by its ability to predict in sample, that is predicting within the data set used for training. Obviously the results should be *quite good* as the model uses the same data for predicting and  estimating. 

The overall **in-sample** performance is:  

```{r, results=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rf_pred <- predict(rf_final_fit, train_data)

# Confusion, matrix
c <-  confusionMatrix(rf_pred, train_data$class)
insample_accuracy <- round(c$overall[1], 3)

c$overall[c(1,2)]
```

we have an accuracy of **`r insample_accuracy`**  while the confusion matrix is: 
```{r results=TRUE}
c$table
```


We need now further investigation to see if the model generalizes well or if it just has learned from the training data. A high accuracy is generally a symptom of ***overfitting*** and of possible poor performance on the validation sample. 

### Variable importance

We can check which of the  predictors had an influence in the classification by using the Variable Influence Factor (VIF) on a graphic: 

```{r}
GISVarImportance<- varImp(rf_final_fit, scale = FALSE)
plot(GISVarImportance, title =" VIF (final model)")
```


### The *Out of sample* performance 

We now apply the model to the validation sample, that has not been used for training the model. This is where we will truly see the prediction performances of the model by comparing the predictions with actual real values (or reference in the confusion matrix below. 


```{r, results=TRUE}
rf_pred_Valid <- predict(rf_final_fit, validation_data)
rf_CM <- confusionMatrix(rf_pred_Valid, validation_data$class)
rf_CM$table
```

### Predicted classification on the validation sample

Our validation sample has **`r nrow(validation_data)`** observations. Let's see how the prediction goes on these points: 


```{r, results= TRUE}
pred_valid <-as.data.frame(rf_pred_Valid) 

datasummary_skim(pred_valid , type = "categorical",
                 title = "Prediction",
                 notes = paste("N =", nrow(pred_valid))) 
```

### Visualizing the model prediction per category   

This graphic is an attempt to visualize where the model is not predicting well... TBC with numbers of predictions directly on the bars., etc...
 


```{r}
# A complex to construct, but easy to read, graphic on prediction per category!
# Combine predictions and actual values
comparison <- data.frame(
  Class = validation_data$class, 
  Prediction = pred_valid$rf_pred_Valid,
  Actual = validation_data$class
  )
 

# Reshape the data into a long format
comparison_long <- comparison %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Actual, Prediction),         # Only include these columns
    names_to = "Type",                    # Column to distinguish "Actual" and "Prediction"
    values_to = "Category"                # Values are the category labels
  )

# Count occurrences of each category by Type
comparison_summary <- comparison_long %>%
  group_by(Category, Type) %>%
  count(name = "Count")

# Bar chart with overlays

comparison_summary %>%
mutate(Category = fct_infreq(Category) %>% fct_rev()) %>%  # Reorder and reverse factor levels
ggplot()+
  aes(x = Count , y = Category, fill = Type) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "identity", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Prediction" = SIAP.color, "Actual" = SIAP.red)) +
  labs(
    title = " Observations vs Predictions",
    subtitle = "Grey = correct prediction, Red = Observed (not predicted),  Blue = Predicted (not observed)", ,
    y = "Land type",
    x = "Count",
    fill = "Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

```{r include=FALSE}
knit_exit()
```




## Testing another model: Multinomial Logistic model (MNL)

As for the random forest model, we fist train our model on the `train_data` subsample. We only have to change the `method` in the code and in `train()`function to **multinom** (multinomial logit). 


```{r, cache = FALSE}

# Train your model using the training data set

logi_fit <- train(formula,
                data = train_data,
                method = "multinom", 
                trControl = K5_CV_seed,
                trace = FALSE)
logi_fit
            
```

### The *in sample* performance is:

```{r, results=TRUE}
logi_pred <- predict(logi_fit, train_data)

# Confusion, matrix
confusionMatrix(logi_pred, train_data$class)
```

We need now further investigation to see if the model generalizes well or if it just has learned from the training data. 

### Variable importance


```{r}
LogiVarImportance<- varImp(logi_fit, scale = FALSE)
plot(LogiVarImportance)
```

> Interestingly, the logistic model does not exhibit the same "*important*" variables. 

### The *Out of sample* performance 


```{r, results=TRUE}
logi_pred_Valid <- predict(logi_fit, validation_data)
logi_CM <- confusionMatrix(logi_pred_Valid, validation_data$class)
logi_CM$table


```

The acuracy of the' logistic is:

```{r}
logi_CM$overall[c(1,2)]
```


# Adressing the imbalance problem

## Using Kappa instead on accuracy 

In the presence of imbalance classes, where one or several classes are significantly **underrepresented** compared to others, we should prefer using **kappa** instead of **accuracy** to select the best model.
**Kappa** is similar to the classic accuracy measure, but it is able to take into consideration the data sets class imbalance. The definition is: 

$$ \kappa = \frac{p_o-p_e}{1-p_e}  $$

where $p_o$ is the accuracy of the model, and $p_e$ is the measure of the agreement between the model predictions and the actual class values as if happening by chance.^[See *e.g..* https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/82162/cohens-kappa-in-plain-english for the detail of the computation of $p_e$.] The *Kappa* value indicates how much better the model is performing compared to a different model that makes random classifications based on the distribution of the target variable.

For binary classification **Kappa** can be rewritten as an expression of True Positives (TP), False Negatives (FN), False Negatives (FN), and False Positives (FP):

$$ \kappa = \frac{2(TP \cdot TN - FN \cdot FP)}{(TP + FP) \cdot (FP + TN)+ (TP+FN) \cdot (FN + TN)} $$

## Resampling techniques

There are several methods for handling imbalanced classes in a multivariate (multi-class) classification problem. Using the `caret` package, we can use several resampling techniques:

- up-sampling, down-sampling,
- SMOTE, and
- ROSE

The idea is always to resample to have a more balance sample with almost the same number of observation in each class and avoid over-predicting the dominant class. We can combine this with the choice of Kappa as the metric to select the "best" model. 


### Up and down sampling 
Both up-sampling and down-sampling are techniques that change the distribution of the classes by removing or duplicating observations.To do that, one randomly duplicate observations or remove some 

- **Up**: increase the number of instances in the minority class (less frequent class) by randomly **duplicating** observations from the minority class or by generating synthetic examples using techniques like SMOTE (see below).

- **Down**: decrease the number of instances in the majority class (most frequent class) by randomly **removing** observations from the majority class until the class distribution is balanced with the minority class.

> Up-sampling increases the size of the dataset, while down-sampling decreases it.

                metric= "Kappa",
                trControl = K5_CV_seed_down)

```


## SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

In that technique, one create a new training sample from the original one.
SMOTE works by generating new **synthetic** examples that are close in the feature space (some twins). For each minority class example selected, SMOTE finds its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space (typically Euclidean distance is used). It then creates new examples by choosing one of the k-nearest neighbors randomly and using it to create a new synthetic instance at a randomly selected point between the chosen neighbor and the original example. By increasing the number of minority class samples, SMOTE helps to balance the class distribution and improve the performance of machine learning models in predicting the minority class. 

 
```{r}
library(smotefamily)

# Apply SMOTE to the training data
train_sub<- train_data%>% select(-contains(c("class", "Id")))
smote_data <- SMOTE(train_sub, train_data$class, K = 5, dup_size = 0)

# Convert the oversampled data into a proper data frame
train_data_smote <- as.data.frame(smote_data$data)
train_data_smote$class <- as.factor(train_data_smote$class)


rf_fit_smote <- train(formula,
                data =  train_data_smote,
                method = "rf",
                ntree = 100,
                metric= "Kappa",
                trControl = K5_CV_seed_down)

rf_fit_smote
```
 
 
##  Comparing all models

All these models use different parameters and have specific advantages and drawbacks. We may still want to compare their **predictive performances** on the various measures of fit. For that we will plot the distribution of the values of these indicators on all the validation samples, for each model.

### Comparing acuracies

It is important to compare models base on one of the "metrics" available. In our case, we will focus on "Accuracy" or "Kappa" as these are the most relevant. But one may as well be focusing on one particular class specificity if there is one class that one wish to predict well.  

```{r modelsperf}
models <- list( RF =rf_fit, 
                Logit = logi_fit, 
                RF_up = rf_fit_up,
                RF_down = rf_fit_down, 
                RF_Smote =  rf_fit_smote)
                
perf <- resamples(models)

colvec <- c('#fbb4ae','#b3cde3','#ccebc5','#decbe4','#fed9a6','#ffffcc')

        names = names(models), col=colvec,
        main = "Accuracy",
        sub = "Accuracy of all CV validation sets,on all models", 
        frame.plot = FALSE)
```

        main= "Kappa",
        sub = "Kappa of all CV validation sets, on all models",

# Predictions on the whole area

We now take the whole image and predict on all pixels using the model that we estimated. 

## Predictions with *Random Forest*
While doing the prediction on the whole area (each pixel of the raster on the ROI), we  export the results to a *.tif* file that will be used in QGIS. 

```{r}
# We will store the prediction in a temp folder: 
dir.create("Predictions_with_R", showWarnings = FALSE)

# prediction with Random Forest model
rf_result <- predict(img,
